OWASP Click Me
==============
Written by Arun Kumar,

The OWASP Click Me Project aimed at having a simple GUI which helps to create a test page for Clickjacking attacks.This type of attack occurs when a malicious site tricks a 

user into clicking on a hidden element that belong to another site which they have loaded in a hidden frame or iframe. OWASP Click Me tool will help you to test whether your site 

is vulnerable to this attack by creating a html page that will try to load your web site from a frame.

Requirements :
Currently 3 formats of the tool is available 

A simple html version is there,where you can directly load the html in browser and give the test url.

Java GUI is also there,need JRE to run the jar file.

Python script is also available.

The OWASP Click Me Project is free to use. It is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
